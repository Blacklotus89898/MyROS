1. Research and Planning (list and save interesting sources and documentation)
2. Designing test for success / ignore failing case (track erros, mistatkes, when succes log into iteration)
3. Find alternative implementation + Compare (branch out into different approaches)
4. Perform isolation test
5. Review and traceback if unsatisfied
6. Optimization and refining (can branch out into multiple versions)
7. Package the solution for presentation (get ready for code review, design review and further testing)
8. Finalize documentation + (list all instruction on program execution and dependencies in README.md)
